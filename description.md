# D3
This talk will cover the basics of the JavaScript visualization library
[d3](d3js.org). We'll start off with the fundamental part of d3: the
*data join*, and continue with looking at many different ways of using d3.
In spirit of d3 we're going to look at lots of real examples!
If we get the time I'll try to demonstrate how you can use WebSockets
(what Lars Tiede talked about a couple weeks ago) to make a dynamic graph
visualization.

I'll post the presentation and examples to
[github.com/fjukstad/d3-presentation](github.com/fjukstad/d3-presentation)
when they're ready.
